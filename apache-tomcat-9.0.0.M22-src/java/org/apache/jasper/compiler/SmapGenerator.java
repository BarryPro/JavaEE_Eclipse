     * The SMAP syntax is reasonably straightforward.  The purpose of this
     * class is currently twofold:
     *  - to provide a simple but low-level Java interface to build
     *    a logical SMAP
     *  - to serialize this logical SMAP for eventual inclusion directly
     *    into a .class file.
     *
     * There are aspects of the SMAP syntax that this class does not support.
     * It provides all the features required for JSP and associated files but no
     * more.
